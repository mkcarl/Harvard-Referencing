# Reference-Generator
This project is written in Python 3.7. It is aimed to aid students like myself to simplify the task of doing referencing in university assignments. The referencing method used is Harvard Referencing and is based on the comprehensive guide provided on the APU Library page on Harvard Referencing (http://library.apiit.edu.my/harvard-referencing-style/).
